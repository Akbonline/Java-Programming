# P2P Project

Code implemented for the 2015 Computer Networks (CNT5106C) class project at UF.

The project asked to implement a simplified version of the BitTorrent protocol (just the file sharing, and simplified choking/unchoking, no tracking).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dalton/cnt5106c/wiki) for the protocol specifications.
